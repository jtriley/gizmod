Introduction:
-------------

Gizmo Daemon is an advanced input device controller that enables any Linux
input device to be used for any purpose imaginable.  Input events can be
mapped to control applications (console and X11), the ALSA system mixer
volume, Amarok, or any other application.  Events can be directed at 
other devices as well (keyboards, mice, force feedback, joysticks, LIRC 
remotes, etc).

Gizmo Daemon also offers support for devices with visualization capabilities
(such as the Griffin PowerMate's LED).  In this way a number of system events
can be sent to any devices which have visualization abilities.  Current
monitor plugins include: system volume, CPU usage, sound output from
any libVisual compatible music player (such as Amarok), and more!  This 
means you'll be able to watch your PowerMate (or any other 
supported device) dance in time to music!

Dependencies:
-------------

Gizmo Daemon depends on the Linux Kernel's event input system, X11, 
ALSA, boost, and Python in order to be compiled.  Note that compiling 
from source means you need to have the development packages installed.

Installation:
-------------

- Make sure the input event system is enabled in your kernel config options:

	Device Drivers --->
	   Input Device Support -->
	      <M> Event interface

- After enabling the event system make sure permissions are correct.  Check
  /dev/input/* to make sure the current user / group has read / write
  privileges.  Modern systems make use of udev rules to change permissions
  on the devices, however this is beyond the scope if this document.

- If you have a PowerMate make sure it's module is enabled as well!

	Device Drivers --->
	   USB support --->
	      <M> Griffin PowerMate and Contour Jog support

- Install the Python scripting language via your distributions package management
  system (Note: be sure to install the dev packages too!).  Or download and 
  install from http://python.org.

- Install boost.  http://boost.org

- If you wish to use Gizmo Daemon's libVisual support you should 
  have it installed prior to compilation.

- Download (http://gizmod.sourceforge.net)

- Unpack, and install:

	tar jxvf gizmod-version.tar.bz2
	CFLAGS="-O2" CXXFLAGS="-O2" ./configure --prefix=/usr \
		--sysconfdir=/etc --with-boost
	make
	make install
	
- Note that the configuration files are stored in: /etc/gizmod

- Launch the user space daemon:

	gizmod&
